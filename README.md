Gradle plugin for AspectJ binary weaving. It works similar to https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-maven-plugin 
doing the weaving on the weaving over already compiled classes. It is particularly helpful if the source code
  is written in a language different from Java. For example, [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), as it produces 
  fully compatible Java bytecode. It goes without saying that the plugin works for Java sources as well. 
  
  
  > The plugin uses AspectJ 1.8.9 to be compatible with Java 7, versions 1.8.10 and higher
   requires Java 8. Mind that AspectJ 1.8.9 doesn't support Java 11.
      
  
### Usage

  Here is an example project in the `examples` folder. Basically you need to add the plugin to your build script
  
      buildscript {
        repositories {
          jcenter()
        }
        dependencies {
          classpath "com.github.sedovalx.gradle:gradle-aspectj-binary:$pluginVersion"
        }
      }
      
      apply plugin: 'com.github.sedovalx.gradle-aspectj-binary'
      
  `weaveClasses` task becomes available after that. It makes sense to add it as a dependency for the `classes` task
  
      weaveClasses.dependsOn compileJava
      classes.dependsOn weaveClasses
  
  so you can just run the build and have all your aspects in the `main` source set applied.
  
  > You need to weave both aspects and classes where aspects should be applied. So if you have aspect 
  classes in a project A and classes to be weaved in a project B you should add the `weaveClasses` task to the build 
  process of both projects.
  
### Available configuration
  
  For now the `weaceClasses` task can be configured with the next parameters
  
      weaveClasses {
        source = '1.7'  
        target = '1.7'  
        writeToLog = true 
      }
      
  Parameters:
  - `source` has '1.7' as default value and is passed as it is to the [ajc](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/devguide/ajc-ref.html) compiler parameter
  - `target` has '1.7' as default value and is passed as it is to the [ajc](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/devguide/ajc-ref.html) compiler parameter
  - `writeToLog` has `false` as a default value and defines if ajc's compile messages should 
  affect the build process. In case of value is `true` all the messages are written in the 
  `build/ajc.log` file and do not affect the build result. Otherwise, error or warning messages are 
  printed in the build output and ajc errors (if any) break the build process.   

### Clean local build

The examples project depends on a version of the plugin. In case of a clean build no plugin version exists in 
the repository. So I use a little bit hacky way to do the trick.

     $ echo "include 'plugin'" > settings.gradle
     $ ./gradlew clean :plugin:publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenLocal
     $ echo "include 'plugin', 'examples'" > settings.gradle
     $ ./gradlew :examples:run
